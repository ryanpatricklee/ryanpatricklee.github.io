									<div>I’m a data analyst with a background in mathematics and statistics. I've spent the last 10 years improving my expertise as a college mathematics and statistics instructor. While I've greatly enjoyed teaching, my transition to data analysis is driven by my desire to apply my analytical and critical thinking skills to solving real-world business challenges.</div>
									<br>
									<div>My experience in education has enabled me to effectively explain complex concepts in a clear and engaging presentation. I bring a strong foundation in mathematical and analytical rigor, and I excel in problem-solving, pattern recognition, and critical thinking. My background has nurtured a keen eye for detail and a relentless pursuit of accuracy, ensuring that any analysis I perform is thorough and reliable.</div>

These stations are located throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Goal</h3>
										<p>To better understand the behavior of NY Citi Bike's customer base (subscribers and customers) and how they use NY Citi Bikes.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Purpose & Context</h3>
										<p>This project was part of my data analytics course at CareerFoundry to showcase the technical skills needed to analyze data using Python and the soft skills needed to communicate insights using Tableau.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Data Set Used</h3>
										<p>201903-citibike-tripdata (Source: <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/">NY Citi Bike</a>)<br>
										<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201903-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip" class="primary button">Download</a></p>
									<h3 class="major">Data Preparation</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Downloaded the data set and imported it into Jupyter notebook as a pandas dataframe.</li>
											<li>Wrote a python script to wrangle the data. This involved:
												<ul>
													<li>Checking for missing valeus and dealing with them.</li>

									<h3 class="major">Insights and Data Visualizations</h3>
										<p>There were several insights and visualizations made for this project. Here are some of them.</p>
										<h3>Where are the most popular pick-up stations?</h3>
											<div style="width: 98%; padding: 1%;">
												<img src="images/bike1.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
											</div>
											<p>The most popular pick-up station is Pershing Square, followed by 8 Ave & W 31 St, W 21 St & 6 Ave, E 17 St & Broadway, and Broadway & E 22 St.</p>
										<h3>Which age group rents bikes most frequently?</h3>
											<div style="width: 98%; padding: 1%;">
												<img src="images/bike2.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
											</div>
											<p>NY Citi Bike users age 26-35 years rent bikes most frequently, followed by users age 36 to 45 years and users age 46 to 55 years.</p>
										<h3>How does bike rental frequency vary across user type on different days of the week?</h3>
											<div style="width: 98%; padding: 1%;">
												<img src="images/bike3.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
											</div>
											<p>NY Citi Bike users are predominantly made up of subscribers who are most active throughout the week. NY Citi Bike customers, however, are more active during the weekend.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Monitor bike availability at Pershing Square North, 8 Ave & W 31 St, W 21 St & 6 Ave, E 17 St & Broadway, and Broadway & E 22 St to determine if more bikes need to be installed there.</li>
											<li>The NY Citi Bike customer base is mostly subscribers age 26 to 55 years who are most active during the week. This tells us that they are probably users who live in New York and use NY Citi Bikes to commute. Marketing and advertising compaigns should target this demographic.</li>

						<!-- Influenza -->
							<article id="influenza">
								<h2>Preparing for Influenza in the United States</h2>
									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
										<p>The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. A medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.</p>
									<h3 class="major">Goal</h3>
										<p>Help the medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as- needed basis by determining when to send staff, and how many, to each state, with the following criteria:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>A staffing plan that utilizes all available agency staff per state requirements, without necessitating additional resources.</li>
												<li>Minimal instances of staff-to- patient ratio below 90% and above 110%.</li>
											</ul>
									<h3 class="major">Purpose & Context</h3>
										<p>This project was part of my data analytics course at CareerFoundry to showcase the technical skills needed to analyze data using Excel and the soft skills needed to communicate insights.</p>
										<!--his was done in three phases:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Distill business requirements and requests into questions that can be answered with analysis.</li>
											<li>Follow up by sourcing and curating the data to address those questions.</li>
											<li>After analyzing the data and drawing conclusions, present insights to stakeholders in an easily consumable format.</li>
										</ul>-->
									<h3 class="major">Data Sets Used</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender (Source: <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html">CDC</a>)<br><a href="https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/da_program/CDC_Influenza_Deaths_edited.xlsx" class="primary button">Download</a></li>

										</ul>
								<h3 class="major">Data Preparation</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Created a list of data questions that needs answering for analysis.</li>
										<li>Designed a data research project and formulated a research hypothesis.</li>
										<li>Looked at the data set to understand the source, coverage, relevance, and limitations, ensuring it aligns with the business requirements.</li>
										<li>Created a data profile for each of the data sets to be used in analysis, including information on data types, data integrity issues (accuracy and consistency), any cleaning that was conducted, as well as summary statistics in each profile.</li>
										<li>Implemented additional data quality measures to data profiles related to completeness, uniqueness, and timeliness.</li>
									</ul>
								<h3 class="major">Analysis</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Integrated data from two sources into one cohesive data set by aggregating the data, applying data transformations, and using VLOOKUP( ).</li>
										<li>Normalized the influenza death count for each state to obtain the mortality rate for each state.</li>
										<li>Identified a relationship between population size and influenza deaths and checked for correlation.</li>
										<li>Formulated a statistical hypothesis regarding age and influenza deaths.</li>
										<li>Tested the hypothesis by performing a statistical test and interpreting the results.</li>
										<li>Created an interim report consolidating the findings of the analysis.</li>
										<li>Used Tableau to create visualizations to construct insights for strategically allocating additional medical staff for each state throughout the year.</li>
									</ul>
								<h3 class="major">Insights and Data Visualizations</h3>
									<div style="width: 100%;">
										<h3>Who is impacted most by influenza?</h3>
											From 2009 to 2017, more than 40,000 people in the United States die from influenza every year. While every age group is impacted by influenza, the older populations (people 65 years or older) are impacted the most. The data shows at least 88% of influenza deaths in the United States were people 65 years or older.
											<div style="width: 70%; padding: 3%;">
												<img src="images/flu1.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%" />
											</div>
										<h3>When is influenza season in the United States?</h3>
											Death from influenza happens all year round, but there is a seasonal trend across the four regions in the United States. This seasonal trend allowed for an accurate forecast for the year 2018.
											<div style="float: left; width: 100%; padding: 3%;">
												<img src="images/flu2.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%" />
											</div>	
										<h3>Which states need more assistance?</h3>
											The majority of influenza deaths are people 65 years or older. Consequently, states with a higher population count tend to have more people 65 years or older, and therefore, are accompanied with a higher influenza death count.
											<div style="float: left; width: 85%; padding: 3%;">
												<img src="images/flu3.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%" />
											</div>	
									</div>
								<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
									<p>Since influenza occurs all-year-round in the United States, temporary staff should be sent all-year-round. The amount of staff sent to each state should be adjusted on a monthly basis depending on the need of each state.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>High-need states: California, Florida, New York, Texas</li>
											<li>Medium-need states: Washington, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan</li>
											<li>Low-need states: The rest of the United States not mentioned above</li>
										</ul>
									<p>During the peak season of influenza, 75% of staff should be allocated to medium-need and high-need states and 25% of staff should be allocated low-need states. During off-peak season, 40-50% of staff should be allocated to high-need states and 50-60% of staff should be allocated to medium-need and low-need states.</p>

										<div style="width: 100%;">
											<h3>Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?</h3>
												Rockbuster's film database contains 1000 distinct films. Sports films contribute most to revenue while music films contribute least to revenue. However, this could be due to there being more sports films to rent and fewer music films to rent.
												<div style="width: 80%; padding: 1%;">
													<img src="images/dvd1.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
												</div>
											<h3>Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?</h3>
												Rockbuster customers can be found across the globe. In particular, a large number of Rockbuster customers can be found in India or China.
												<div style="width: 80%; padding: 1%;">
													<img src="images/dvd2.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
												</div>
											<h3>Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?</h3>
											The geographic regions with the largest revenue are Asia, America, and Europe, which combined make 82.7% of the total revenue earned.
												<div style="width: 95%; padding: 1%;">
													<img src="images/dvd3.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
												</div>
										</div>
									<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
										<p>Rockbuster has a good variety of film categories, but it is missing other categories like romance, war, crime, mystery, thriller, and other various categories that could attract more rentals from new or existing customers.</p>
										<p>Rockbuster lacks a high number of customers. To attract new customers, consider either a free trial or discounted pricing for new customers. Or consider rewarding existing customers who refer new customers to join the Rockbuster family.</p>
										<p>Rockbuster's revenue come mostly from the Americas, Europe, and Asia. To increase revenue from the other regions, focus more of the marketing to the Carribean, Oceania, Middle East, and Africa regions.</p>

										<h3>How often do Instacart customers return to shop?</h3>
											<p>Instacart customers mostly return after 7 days or 30 days.</p>
											<div style="width: 80%; padding: 1%;">
												<img src="images/cart4.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
											</div>
											<p>Customers were segmented based on how frequently they returned to shop. If a customer's median days since prior order is:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>10 or fewer: label the customer as a frequent customer</li>
													<li>20 or fewer but more than 10: label the customer as a regular customer</li>
													<li>More than 20: label the customer as a non-frequent customer</li>
												</ul>
											<p>With this segmentation, frequent customers typically return to shop in about 7 days, regular customers typically return to shop in about 14 days, and non-frequent customers return to shop in about 28 days.</p>
											<div style="width: 80%; padding: 1%;">
												<img src="images/cart5.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
											</div>
									<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
										<p>Since the slowest days are Tuesday and Wednesday, the marketing team should focus their advertisements on Tuesday and Wednesday to increase more orders from their customers on these days. Avoid advertising between the hours of 11:00pm to 7:00am; otherwise advertising efforts will be missed by customers likely due to customers sleeping during these hours of the day.</p>
										<p>If not already implemented, have a subscription service for customers who purchase goods on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis. For example, frequent customers would likely enjoy a weekly subscription for certain goods, regular customers would likely enjoy a biweekly subscription for certain goods, and non-frequent customers would likely enjoy a monthly subscription for certain goods.</p>

											<li>Looked at the data set to understand the source, coverage, and relevance, ensuring it aligns with the business requirements.</li>
											<li>Categorized the types of data, characteristics, and potential bias in the data set.</li>
											<li>Removed duplicate records and removed columns not relevant for analysis.</li>
											<li>Checked columns for missing values and either imputed the missing values or removed the records with missing values if imputing was not appropriate.</li>
											<li>Corrected format inconsistencies and inaccuracies.</li>
											<li>Used pivot tables to transform the data into something more usable and insightful.</li>
											<li>Created groups so that similar items can be analyzed together.</li>
											<li>Analyzed sales in North America market to get an idea of how games perform in the most popular market.</li>
											<li>Filtered the data to look at specific subsegments.</li>
											<li>Created new variables to glean as many insights as possible.</li>
											<li>Isolated the most interesting findings about the data.</li>
											<li>Decided which type of analysis to pursue in response to business challenges.</li>
											<li>Obtained descriptive statistics of video game sales across the regions to understand their statistical properties.</li>
										</ul>
									<h3 class="major">Insights and Data Visualizations</h3>
										<p>There were several insights and visualizations made for this project. Here are a couple of them.</p>
											<h3>How have sales figures performed across the various geographic regions over time?</h3>
												<p>
													GameCo assumed video game sales for the four various geographic regions have stayed the same over time. According to the data, however, it is clearly not that way at all. Sales (number of units sold) were increasing prior to 2008, and then sales began declining after 2008.
													<div style="width: 90%; padding: 1%;">
														<img src="images/game1.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
													</div>
												</p>
											<h3>How has ratio of regional sales to global sales varied across the geographic regions over time?</h3>
												<p>
													To get a better idea on how to allocate the marketing budget for the year 2017, we looked at the historical proportion of sales for each region. Looking at the last 10 years (2007 - 2016), we can see that North America has been the leader in proportion of sales with a noticeable steady decline. Furthermore, we can the proportion of sales from Europe is steadily rising, eventually surpassing that of North America in 2016.
													<div style="width: 90%; padding: 1%;">
														<img src="images/game2.jpg" alt="", style="width: 100%"/>
													</div>
												</p>
									<h3 class="major">Recommendations</h3>
										<p>Allocate 32% of the marketing budget to North America at the start of 2017. Since proportion of sales for North America is declining, decrease allocation to 25% by the end of 2017.</p>
										<p>Allocate 38% of the marketing budget to Europe at the start of 2017. Since proportion of sales for Europe is increasing, increase allocation to 45% by the end of 2017.</p>
										<p>Allocate 19% of the marketing budget to Japan at the start of 2017. Since proportion of sales in Japan have declined overall, decrease allocation to 18% by the end of 2017.</p>
										<p>Allocate 11% of the marketing budget to other regions at the start of 2017. Since proportion of sales for other regions is slowly rising, increase allocation to 12% by the end of 2017.</p>

												Pivot tables were made to check the percentage of how many clients exited the bank in comparison to those who stayed. The top 3 factors that contribued to client loss are:
													<ol>
														<li>Whether or not the client is an active member</li>
														<li>Whether or not the client is 37 years or older</li>
														<li>Whether or not the client had an account balance of $93,700 or higher</li>
